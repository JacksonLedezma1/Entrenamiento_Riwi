# üõçÔ∏è Mini Online Store

Welcome to the Mini Online Store! This project is a simple web application to manage products and simulate shopping with a cart, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Product data is stored and managed through a REST API simulated with **json-server**.

---

## üß© About the Code and Its Features

The core of the application is in the `gestion_api.js` file, which handles all the logic for interacting between the interface and the simulated database. Below are the main features of the code:

- **Product loading:** On startup, a GET request is made to the API to display all available products in the store.
- **Add products:** Shows a form to enter a new product. Validates the data and makes a POST request to save it in the database.
- **Update products:** Shows a form to select and edit an existing product. Makes a PUT/PATCH request to update the data in the database.
- **Delete products:** Allows you to select a product and, after confirmation, deletes it from the database with a DELETE request.
- **Shopping cart:** Lets you add products to the cart, control the quantity (without exceeding stock), display the total, and clear the cart.
- **Validations and messages:** The code includes validations to prevent incorrect data and displays error or success messages according to the action performed.

The code is commented and structured to make it easy to understand and modify. You can explore each function in `gestion_api.js` to see how each action is handled and how the interface is updated in real time.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project?

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
3. Install **json-server** globally (if you don't have it):

   npm install -g json-server
   ```
4. From the `Entregable_semana_3` folder, run the server:
   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
   ```
5. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser.
